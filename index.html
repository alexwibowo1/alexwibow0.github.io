						<h2>WORD ORDER (PART 2)</h2>
                 <p>Material Description</p>
                <p> The Position of Noun in a Sentence</p>
                <p> Noun is one of parts of speech that has important function in a sentence. Nouns can
                    be a person, place, thing, or idea. The position of noun in a sentence is based on the
                    function. Noun acts as the subject of a sentence that performs the action of the verb.
                    The subject in a sentence must be noun, pronoun or noun phrase. It cannot be a verb,
                    an adverb, or an adjective. Besides, the noun also functions as a direct object, indirect
                    object, object of preposition, or a complement.</p>
                <p> a. Noun as a subject</p>
                     <p> The subject can be a person, thing or idea. It performs an act or shows a state
                    of being as expressed by the verb. In positive sentence, the subject usually comes
                    at the beginning of a sentence and comes before the verb.
                    Examples:</p>
                    <p>1. Nuclear power gives us about 17 % of the world’s electricity.
                        The subject of the sentence above is a noun phrase, Nuclear power. It
                        comes before the verb gives.</p>
                    <p>2. A YouTube member can create a video clip with his cell phone.
                        The subject of the sentence above is a noun phrase, a You Tube member. It
                        comes before the verb can create.</p>
                    <p>3. The Internet can be accessed not only on your computer but, but by
                        other devices as well.</p>
                 <p> b. Noun as object </p>   
                        <p> A sentence usually has an object. An object of a sentence can be a noun,
                            pronoun, or noun phrase on which a verb performs an acion. It completes the
                            meaning of a sentence. A sentence does not make sense, in terms of the action it
                            shows, without an object. The object is usually placed after the verb. The objective is
                            usually a direct object, an indirect object, or an object of preposition. Some verbs
                            can be followed by two objects, a direct object and an indirect object.</p>
                        <p> Subject – Verb – Indirect object – direct object</p>
                        <p> Example :</p>
                        <p> 1. The president awarded Jane a gold medal.</p>
                        <p> 2. My father told me an interesting story.</p>
                        <p>3. We promised our son a nice reward.</p>
                <p> Position of Adjective in a Sentence</p>
                <P> Adjective is a word that functions to describe a noun. Adjective modifies and gives
                    more information to the noun. For example: Microsoft Word is a word-processing
                    program sold by Bill Gate’s company, Microsoft. The adjective of the sentence is wordprocessing which modifies the noun program. The adjective gives more information
                    about the program by indicating its type. An adjective can be either before or after the
                    noun that it describes. Generally, adjectives come before a noun. </P>
                        <P>  There are several
                            positions of adjective in a sentence, they are:</P>
                        <p>a. Adjective that comes before a noun</p>
                        <p> Adjective that comes before a noun is called an attributive adjective. It modifies
                            the noun that follows it. There can be more than one adjective that comes before
                            noun (attributive adjective)</p>
                        <p> b. Adjective that comes after a noun</p>
                        <p> Adjective that comes after a noun is called a predicative adjective. Predicative
                            adjective modifies the noun that comes before it The predicative adjective also
                            appears after link verb. Adjective after a linking verb functions as a subject
                            complement. It means that the adjective gives more information about the subject
                            of the sentence. The examples of linking verb are am, is, are, was, were, appear,
                            look, taste, become, feel, get, seem, smell, and etc.</p>
                        <p> c. Attributive and predicative adjectives in same sentence</p>
                        <p> The attributive and predicative adjective can come in the same sentence. The
                            adjectives modifies the same noun. The position of these adjectives are before and
                            after the noun. It means that the noun is between them</p>
                        <p> d. Post-positive adjective</p>
                        <p> The adjectives that are coming immediately after noun or pronoun are called
                            post-positive adjectives.</p>
                        <p> e. Order of Adjective</p>
                        <p> In a sentence, there sometimes consist of two or some adjectives that describe a
                            noun. The following shows the categories of adjective in a row that modify a noun
                            in the right order</p>
                        <p> The Position of Verb in a Sentence</p>
                        <p> Verbs usually come after the subjects. There are mainly two kinds of verbs.
                            They are auxiliary verb and main verbs. A verb can consist of only one word. The
                            positive sentences of simple present and simple past tense have one-word verbs. For
                            example: They work in a software company. This sentence has one-word verb that is
                            placed after the subject. Sentences in other tenses have more than one verbs, such as two-word verb, or threeword verb. They consist of auxiliary verb and main verb. </p>
                        <p> For the two-word verb, the first is an auxiliary verb, and the second is a main
                            verb. For example: Santi is operating a laptop in her office. This sentece has a twoword verb that is placed after the subject. Is in the sentence is an auxiliary verb, and
                            operating in the sentence is a main verb. For the three-word verbs, the first and the
                            second are auxiliary verb, and the third is main verb. For example: They have been
                            invited to the party. The auxiliary verbs of the sentence are have and been, and the
                            main verb is invited. Auxiliary verbs always come before main verbs for positive and
                            negative sentences, but in a question, they come before the subject whereas the main
                            verb comes after the subject.</p>
                   
                            <p> Adverbs are words that describe verbs, adjectives, other adverbs, or clauses. The
                                position of adverbs in the sentence can be at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end
                                of the sentence.</p>
                            <p>1. Initial Position </p>
                            <p> The adverb that is placed at the beginning of the sentence is usually called
                                as Initial Position. Connecting adverbs and time adverbs are usually placed at
                                the beginning of the sentence.</p>
                            <p> 2. Middle Position</p>
                            <p> The adverbs that are placed in the middle position are also called as focusing
                                adverbs. Focusing adverbs put the emphasis on one part of the clause in order
                                to modify, qualify, or add information.</p>
                            <p> 3. End Position</p>
                            <p> Most adverbs are placed at the end of the sentence or phrase</p>
                            <p> a. Adverb of manner</p>
                            <p>  of manner
                                Adverb of manner tells us how something is done. It usually
                                answers the question how. The adverbs of manner are commonly
                                placed at the end of a sentence. The examples of adverb of manner are
                                well, quickly, softly, loudly, beautifully, and etc.
                                </p>
                            <p> b. Adverb of place</p>
                            <p> Adverb of place tells us where something is done. It usually
                                answers the question where. The advers of place are commonly placed
                                at the end of the sentence. The examples of adverb of place are here,
                                downstairs, outside, inside, downtown, and etc.</p>

                <h2>PHRASAL VERB</h2>
                 <p>Material Description</p>
                 <p> Phrasal verbs are phrases that indicate actions. They are generally used
                    in spoken English and informal texts. Examples of such verbs include: turn
                    down, come across and run into. Phrasal verb is a verb that combined with an adverb or preposition.
                    Many phrasal verbs gave more one meaning. Sometimes the meaning of
                    phrasal verb is very similar to the base verbs, and the adverb just emphasizes
                    the meaning of the base verb. </p>
                <p> Phrasal verb is a verb like pick up, turn on or get on with. These verbs
                    consist of a basic verb + another word or words. The two or three words that
                    make up a phrasal verb form a short "phrase" - which is why we call them
                    "phrasal verbs". But a phrasal verb is still a verb. Look is a verb. Look up is
                    also a verb - a different verb. They do not have the same meaning, and they
                    behave differently grammatically. You should treat each phrasal verb as a
                    separate verb, and learn it like any other verb.</p>
					<p>When added to the verb the preposition or adverb may change
						completely the meaning of the verb. Here are some examples:</p>
					<p class="gambar">
					<img src="web inggris.png"/> 
                <p> a. These phrasal verbs can be transitive and intransitive:</p>
                <p> - Transitive</p>
                <p> The same meaning of transitive and intransitive applies to phrasal
                    verbs in the same way as it does to normal verbs. A transitive phrasal
                    verb takes an object. For example: Hang up your jacket.</p>
                <p>When a phrasal verb is transitive, it’s possible to put the object
                    between the verb and the adverb/preposition, or put it afterwards. There is no
                    difference in meaning. For example: Take off your jacket or Take your
                    jacket off. </p>
                <p>- Intransitive </p>
                <p> Intransitive phrasal verbs are easier to use because there is no object
                    to worry about. Here are some examples of intransitive phrasal verbs:</p>
                <p> - The plane took off and landed on time. (left the ground)</p>
                <p>- Where did you grow up? – In a small town just outside this city. (live
                    your childhood) </p>
                <p> - This car is terrible. It breaks down all the time! (stops working) </p>
                <p>- You’re doing really well, so carry on like this. (continue) </p>
                <p> - He started a university course but dropped out after one year. (left/stop
                    participating)</p>
                <p> Now you know more about transitive and intransitive verbs, start paying
                    attention to them when you study. When you meet a new phrasal verb, make a
                    note of whether it’s transitive or intransitive so you know if you can separate the
                    verb or not. And make your own examples too to help you remember them more
                    easily.</p>
                <p>b. The meaning of phrasal verbs </p>
                <p>Sometimes, it is difficult to understand the meaning of phrasal verbs. Before looking
                    them up in a dictionary, it would be helpful to use the context to understand them.
                    Literal meaning </p>
                <p>Some phrasal verbs have a literal meaning. They can be easily understood. </p>
                <p>- She opened the door and looked outside. </p>
                <p>- She was walking across the street when she heard the sound of an
                    explosion. </p>
                <p>c. Separable or inseparable? </p>
                <p> 1. Sometimes, the preposition/adverb is placed either after the verb or after the
                    \object.</p>
                <p> Examples:</p>
                <p> - Mary made up a really entertaining story. </p>
                <p> 2. If the object is a pronoun, however, the preposition/adverb has to be placed
                    after the  pronoun (object).</p>
                <p> Examples:</p>
                <p> She made it up.</p>
                <p> Put it down.</p>
                <p> 3. Some phrasal verbs are always inseparable.</p>
                <p> Example : </p>
                <p> - I came across some old photos in a drawer. </p>

                        <h2>REDUNDANCY</h2>
                         <p>Material Description</p>
                         <p> Redundancy is very important discussion because it is very often used
                            both in conversation and in the writing of English. In learning redundancy, we
                            can see there are two or more words that say the same thing and make it
                            sentences not effective. However, most students have problems in identifying
                            and producing the appropriate words in sentences</p>
                        <p> When something is redundant, it means that it is excessive,
                            unnecessary, or superfluous. Redundancy usually involves repeating something
                            or adding in information that is completely unnecessary. A good way to taste
                            whether or not something is redundant is to see if the phrase in questions could
                            have something removed from it. Redundancy means that excess or waste. A
                            sentence is said redundant if there is a word or group of words that do not need
                            additional sentences that make it is not effective, because a word or group of
                            words that also means additional remains the same</p>
                        <p>Example 1:</p>
                        <p> 1. If all of us cooperate together, we will succeed</p>
                        <p> - In this sentence, the word cooperate and together have been used. But
                            both these words convey the same meaning</p>
                        <p> - One of two words should be dropped in order to make the sentence
                            correct one.</p>
                        <p> - If all of us cooperate, we will succeed. </p>
                        <p> - If all of us together, we will succeed.</p>
                        <p> Example 2:</p>
                        <p> 2. The accused was guilty of false misstatement</p>
                        <p> - The sentence uses false and misstatement, both these words convey
                            the same meaning. </p>
                        <p> Unfortunately, many writers use sentences that are too wordy. This is not to
                            suggest that lengthy sentences can never be used (because they certainly can), but
                            most of the time writers make the mistake of using more words than necessary to get
                            their message across.</p>
                        <p> This sentence is okay and makes sense, though the statement could be more precise if
                            the author phrased it a little differently</p>
                        <p> This sentence conveys the same message and is more succinct and direct. True,
                            the sentence omits that Michelle “was supposed to have her car’s oil changed every
                            3,000 miles,” but we should know this already (or can presume so) from the word
                            “because.” The first sentence is acceptable, but some of the words are superfluous,
                            which can disrupt the flow of your research paper. Just as a machine should not have
                            extra parts, a sentence shouldn’t have any extra words.
                            </p>
                        <p> According to William Strunk and E.B. White, writers should also strive to put statements
                            in the positive form (19). Readers prefer to be told what is, as opposed to what is not.
                            For example, saying “He was late” is usually better than saying “He was not on time.
                            Or, “She forgot” is usually more effective than saying that she “did not remember.”
                            Though these alterations are subtle, they make your writing bolder and more concrete.
                            The authors state, “Use the word not as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as a
                            means of evasion” (19)</p>
                        <p> Redundancy Reduces Conciseness</p>
                        <p>Writing concisely also involves avoiding redundancies. Redundancy is when
                            you use more words than necessary to express something, especially words and/or
                            phrases in the same sentence that mean the same thing. Many writers are guilty of
                            violating this rule at times, especially in their daily conversations. However, as you
                            proofread your papers, try to double-check them for unnecessary phrases that you can
                            omit or edit.</p>
                        <p> Here are some common examples of redundant phrases:</p>
                        <p>- Small in size or large in size</p>
                        <p> - True fact</p>
                        <p>- Basic fundamentals</p>
                        <p>- Past history</p>
                        <p> - Smiled happily</p>
                        <p> - Evolve over time  </p>
                        <p>- Consensus of opinion</p>
                        <p> Think about it: if something is small, it’s small—you don’t need to tack on “in size” for
                            clarification. If an event took place in history, then you wouldn’t need to specify that it
                            took place in “past” history” (as opposed to what, “present” or “future” history?). If
                            something is a “fact,” by definition it’s true (unless the writer is using it for sarcasm or
                            irony). If a person smiled, it can be assumed, in most cases, that the individual was
                            happy; there’s no need to preface the verb with the adverb “happily.” This could
                            depend on context—for example someone could “smile nervously” if they were shy—
                            but in most cases the extra word is unnecessary.</p>
                        <p> Be Careful of Overusing Adverbs</p>
                        <p> Adverbs are often the source of egregious redundancies, and writers should be
                            careful not to overuse them. Stephen King, one of the most successful novelists out
                            there, is certainly not a fan of them: “I believe the road to hell is paved with adverbs,
                            and I will shout it from the rooftops” (118). If you notice that your writing includes an
                            inordinate amount of “–ly” adverbs, then you might need to examine your documents
                            more closely. </p>
                        <p> Here are some examples of unnecessary “ly” adverbs:</p>
                        <p> - Shouted loudly</p>
                        <p> - Race hurriedly</p>
                        <p> - Whispered softly</p>
                        <p> - Finished completely </p>
                        <p> - Jumped quickly </p>
                        <p> Of course, adverbs are not always a bad thing and can in fact be useful when you want
                            to emphasize something to carefully convey meaning. For instance: “Steve drove
                            crazily down the highway, putting every other driver a risk.” In this case, drove, by itself,
                            doesn’t imply anything other that the act of driving. But crazily describes the way in
                            which Steve was driving, so the adverb here is informative and make sense if the
                            reader knows that other drivers were at risk. By contrast, when someone shouts, it’s
                            already implied that he or she is doing so loudly, so there’s no reason for this
                            description because it doesn’t add any extra information. Likewise, you wouldn’t need
                            to inform your reader that someone raced hurriedly (does anyone race slowly?) or
                            whispered softly (does anyone whisper loudly?). </p>
                        <p> Sometimes writers have a habit of overusing adverbs, even if they do make
                            sense. For instance, “Steve drove crazily, chaotically, and wildly down the highway,
                            putting every other driver at risk.” In this case, only one of the adverbs is necessary
                            since they all have the same essential meaning. Because the reader gets the point
                            with just one adverb, the additional ones (i.e., chaotically, wildly) are redundant.</p>
                        <p> Also, you can improve how well you get the message across by eliminating the
                            adverb and choosing a better verb in the first place. For example, “The geologist
                            looked closely at the volcanic rocks that she had found.” This sentence is fine, but
                            here is a different way to say it: “The geologist examined the volcanic rocks that she
                            had found.” Because the geologist examined the rocks, we can assume that she
                            looked at them closely. This is just a subtle change, but it reads a little better. Here’s a
                            rule to keep in mind: weak verbs usually depend on adverbs</p>
                        <p> Redundant words and phrases make your sentences sound repetitive, so do
                            your best to avoid using them. A good exercise to try is to go through the first draft of
                            your next paper and circle every adverb that you spot. Then, look at each of them and
                            determine which ones are needed and which ones you can throw out. Usually, the
                            more adverbs you can eliminate, the stronger your paper will be. You want your
                            arguments to be cogent, of course, but you don’t need to go too far with flowery writing.
                            As Strunk and White say, try to keep it simple and don’t fall into the trap of overwriting:
                            “Rich, ornate prose is hard to digest, generally unwholesome, and sometimes
                            nauseating” (72). You can become a better writer by avoiding redundancies and
                            learning to construct your sentences more concisely</p>
